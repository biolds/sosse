File Downloads
==============

Sosse allows for the automation of file downloads from websites. The example below demonstrates how to download new
eBooks daily from `Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org>`_.

`Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org>`_ is a digital library offering over 75,000 free eBooks, including many
classic literary works.

.. note::
   Project Gutenberg provides several methods for retrieving its content if you wish to download it. See the
   `Offline Catalogs and Feeds <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html>`_ for more information. If you
   wish to download the full database, there are more appropriate methods than crawling, such as the
   `Mirroring How-To <https://www.gutenberg.org/help/mirroring.html>`_. üêû

Creating Crawl Policies
-----------------------

Crawl policies are essential for controlling how Sosse accesses and downloads content from websites. For more details,
see the :doc:`Crawl Policies <../crawl/policies>` documentation.

For Project Gutenberg, we will create two policies:

**RSS Feed Policy**
This policy reads the RSS feed of Project Gutenberg daily to monitor new content. Configure it as follows:

- In the ``‚ö° Crawl`` tab, use a regular expression ``^http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/today.rss$`` to
  target the daily RSS feed.
- In the ``üîñ Archive`` tab, disable ``Archive content`` (as we don't need to archive the original feed).
- In the ``üïë Recurrence`` tab, set ``Crawl frequency`` to ``Constant time`` and clear the ``Recrawl dt max`` field.

**Book Download Policy**
This policy downloads the reference page and the EPUB version of each new book identified in the RSS feed.
Configure it as follows:

- In the ``‚ö° Crawl`` tab, use the regular expressions:

  - ``^https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/[0-9]+$`` for the reference page.
  - ``^https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/[0-9]+.epub3.images$`` and
    ``^https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/.*epub$`` for the EPUB files.

- In the ``üïë Recurrence`` tab, set ``Crawl frequency`` to ``Once`` (as reference pages and books do not need
  updates after initial download). Additionally, clear both the ``Recrawl dt min`` and ``Recrawl dt max`` fields.

Start Crawling
--------------

To start crawling, go to the :doc:`Crawl a new URL <../crawl/new_url>` page and enter the URL od the RSS feed:
``http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/today.rss``.

Check the parameters, then click ``Confirm``. Once confirmed, you will be able to see the crawl queue retrieving the
files from the feed.

View the Library
----------------

To view all the books indexed from the RSS feed, go to the homepage and unfold the ``Params`` section. We can
execute a query to fetch all the pages linked within the RSS feed, with the following parameters:

- Sort: ``First crawled descending``.
- Search options:
  - Acion: ``Keep``
  - Field: ``Linked by URL``
  - Operator: ``Equal to``
  - Value: ``https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/today.rss``

This will display all the books that were loaded from the RSS feed.

Each link will point to the archived page containing information about the book:

Following the link, you will be able to download the book:

Additional Options
------------------

You may also be interested in the :ref:`max_file_size <conf_option_max_file_size>` (defaults to 5 MB) and
:ref:`max_html_asset_size <conf_option_max_html_asset_size>` (defaults to 50 MB) configuration options, which control
the size limits of files being downloaded.

Additionally, you can use the :ref:`atom feed <ui_atom_feeds>` feature to create an Atom feed that points to the
downloaded EPUB files, which could be useful for integrating with an EPUB reader or sharing updates.

Website indexing & Search
=========================

Sosse allows you to crawl a website and search its pages for specific keywords. This process involves configuring
a :doc:`Crawl Policy <../crawl/policies>` to define how the site is crawled, followed by searching for the desired
content.

Creating a Crawl Policy
-----------------------

Crawl policies control how Sosse accesses and logs website content. This section covers key settings; for full details,
see the :doc:`Crawl Policies <../crawl/policies>` documentation.

By default, the crawler processes only directly queued pages. Enabling recursion ensures linked pages are also crawled:

- In the ``âš¡ Crawl`` tab, enter a regular expression to match URLs for crawling.
- In the ``ðŸ”– Archive`` tab, disable ``Archive content`` if you only need to search pages without archiving.
- In the ``ðŸ•‘ Recurrence`` tab, adjust the crawl frequency as needed.

.. note::
   By default, Sosse archives pages, detects if a browser is required for rendering, and adjusts crawl frequency based
   on site updates. Modify the policy to optimize crawl speed or reduce disk usage.

Starting the Crawl
------------------

To begin crawling, go to the :doc:`Crawl a new URL <../crawl/new_url>` page and enter the site's homepage URL.

Review the parameters, then click ``Confirm``. Sosse will crawl the site and log pages matching the Crawl Policy.

.. note::
   If pages arenâ€™t crawled as expected, check whether the siteâ€™s `robots.txt` file is blocking the crawler.
   *Bypass it only if authorized.* You can review this setting in the :doc:`../domain_settings` for the website.

Searching the Website
---------------------

Once crawling is complete, search for keywords directly from the homepage.

For advanced search options, see the :doc:`search parameters <../user/search>` documentation.

``Mime Plugins``.

Mime plugins are automatically executed during crawling when a document's MIME type
matches the plugin's regex pattern. Built-in plugins are provided for common
document types, but custom plugins can also be created.

Mime plugin detailed view
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The mime plugin detail page contains all configuration fields for the plugin:

Name
----

A unique descriptive name for the mime plugin, used for identification within
the admin interface.

Description
-----------

Optional text field to describe what the plugin does. This is particularly
useful for documenting custom plugins.

License
-------

License information for the script, such as "GPL-3.0" or "MIT". This field is
optional and mainly used for built-in plugins.

Enabled
-------

Controls whether this plugin is active during crawling. Disabled plugins will
be ignored even if their MIME type pattern matches.

MIME Type Regex
---------------

One or more regular expressions (one per line) that define which MIME types this
plugin should process. Examples:

* ``^application/pdf$`` - Matches PDF documents only
* ``^image/.*`` - Matches all image types
* ``^application/(msword|vnd\.openxmlformats-officedocument\.wordprocessingml\.document)$`` - Matches Word

Script
------

The shell script that processes the document. The script receives a JSON file path
as the first argument containing document metadata following the REST API format.
This JSON includes a special ``content_file`` field pointing to the actual document
file to process.

The script should output JSON on stdout with fields to update the document (such as
``title``, ``content``, ``lang_iso_639_1``). If the output includes a ``preview``
field, it should specify the filename of a generated thumbnail image in the
working directory.

**Example script:**

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    # Read the input JSON file
    INPUT_JSON="$1"
    DOCUMENT_FILE="$(jq -r .content_file "$INPUT_JSON")"

    # Extract title from document metadata or use URL as fallback
    TITLE="$(jq -r .url "$INPUT_JSON")"

    # Process the document file and extract content
    CONTENT="$(cat "$DOCUMENT_FILE")"

    # Generate a simple preview image (example)
    echo "Preview" | convert -pointsize 20 label:@- preview.png

    # Output JSON with extracted data
    jq -n --arg title "$TITLE" --arg content "$CONTENT" '{
        title: $title,
        content: $content,
        preview: "preview.png"
    }'

.. note::
   The script is executed from a temporary directory that is automatically
   cleaned up after execution. If your script generates a preview image,
   store it in the current working directory (the temporary directory) so
   it gets cleaned up properly. The preview file should be a full-size image
   - Sosse will automatically resize it to create the appropriate thumbnail.

Timeout
-------

Maximum execution time for the script in seconds (default: 30). If the script
takes longer than this timeout, it will be terminated to prevent blocking the
crawler.

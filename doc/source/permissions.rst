User management
===============

User management and group edition can be done from the :doc:`../admin_ui`, by clicking on ``Users`` or ``Groups``.
Thanks to the `Django framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, fine-grained permissions can be defined by group and
by user.

The permission are set by type of objects modifiable through the :doc:`admin_ui`. Some of these permissions also give
access to other parts of the user interface:

- ``Can add document``: gives access to the :doc:`🌐 Crawl a new URL <crawl/new_url>` page
- ``Can change document``: gives access to the document actions (``Crawl now``, ``Remove from crawl queue``,
  ``Convert screens to jpeg``)
- ``Can view crawler stats``: gives access to the :doc:`✔ Crawl queue <crawl/queue>` page and
  :doc:`🕷 Crawlers <crawl/crawlers>` page
- ``Can change crawler stats``: gives access to the ``Pause`` and ``Resume`` crawler button in the
  :doc:`✔ Crawl queue  <crawl/queue>` page and :doc:`🕷 Crawlers <crawl/crawlers>` page

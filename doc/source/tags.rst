‚≠ê Tags
=======

The tagging system allows for efficient searching and categorization of documents by associating them with tags. Tags
can be assigned to documents during the crawling process based on  :doc:`Collections <crawl/collections>`, or they can
be manually added or edited in the :doc:`Archive page <user/archive>` of Documents.

Tags can be accessed by clicking **Tags** from the :doc:`../admin_ui`.

Tags can be modified through the admin interface by selecting a tag and updating its properties:

Editable Fields:

- Name: The label of the tag.
- Parent: Allows organizing tags into a hierarchical structure by selecting a parent tag.
- Documents: A link to the admin interface showing all documents associated with the tag.
- Collections: A link to the admin interface showing all collections that assign this tag.

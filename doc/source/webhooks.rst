ðŸ“¡ Webhooks
===========

Webhooks allow external services to be notified when a page is crawled. The webhook list can be accessed by clicking
**Webhooks** from the :doc:`admin_ui`.

When an event such as a new page discovery or a content change occurs, the corresponding webhook will be triggered,
sending an HTTP request to the specified URL. After creation, the webhook must be registered in
:doc:`Crawl Policies <crawl/policies>`. The execution result can be viewed on the relevant
:doc:`Document's page <documents>`.

Webhook Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""

Webhook Name
------------

A unique name for the webhook, helping in its identification within the admin interface.

Tags filtering
--------------

When tags are specified, the webhook will trigger only for documents that have all the defined tags or are descendants
of those tags. If no tags are specified, the webhook will apply to all documents universally.

Trigger Condition
-----------------

Defines when the webhook should be triggered. Available options:

- **On content change** - Triggers when a document's content is modified.
- **On discovery** - Triggers when a new document is crawled for the first time.
- **On every crawl** - Triggers on every crawl and when manually triggered.
- **On content change or manual crawl** - Triggers when content changes or is manually triggered (default).

.. note::
   Webhooks for a document can also be manually triggered from the :doc:`document's settings <documents>`, regardless of
   the *Trigger Condition* parameter.

Webhook URL
-----------

The endpoint URL where the webhook request will be sent.

Overwrite document's fields with webhook response
-------------------------------------------------

When enabled, this option allows the webhook response to update specific fields in the indexed document. If the webhook
returns data, those corresponding fields will be overwritten with the new values.

.. note::
   Webhooks are executed in alphabetical order. This means simple workflows can be created by prefixing the webhook names
   with numbers (e.g., 1-Webhook, 2-Webhook, etc.) to ensure the desired execution order. Then, the webhook response can be
   used to update the document with tags or other metadata to control the execution of the next webhook.


Path in JSON response
----------------------

This specifies the dotted path within the JSON response that points to the value used for updating the document. For
example, if the JSON response from the webhook is:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "data": {
       "attributes": {
         "title": "Updated Document Title",
         "content": "This is the updated content."
       }
     }
   }

And the "Path in JSON response" is set to ``data.attributes``, only the children of `attributes` will be used to update
the document's title field. This feature is applicable only when the "Overwrite document's fields with webhook response"
option is enabled. If the path is left empty, the entire JSON response will be used to overwrite the document's fields.

Deserialize the response before updating the document
------------------------------------------------------

If enabled, the webhook response will be deserialized as JSON before updating the document. This ensures that the
response is properly parsed into a structured format, allowing fields in the document to be updated accurately based on
the JSON data.

HTTP Method
-----------

The HTTP method used for the request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

JSON Body Template
------------------

A JSON template for the request body, which may include placeholders referencing document fields:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "title": "New page crawled: ${title}",
     "content": "${content}",
     "url": "${url}"
   }

These placeholders will be replaced with actual document values when the webhook is triggered. The available fields,
which support dotted notation for accessing nested properties (e.g., `metadata.author` to retrieve the `author`
field within the `metadata` object), align with those returned by the :doc:`user/rest_api`.

Headers
-------

Additional headers to be included in the request, formatted as:

.. code-block::

   Header-Name: Value
   Another-Header: Value

Each header must be specified on a new line.

.. note::
   In addition to the provided headers, Sosse sends the following headers:

   .. code-block::

      Accept: application/json
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: <User agent>

Authentication
--------------

Basic authentication credentials for accessing the webhook URL:

- **Username** - The username for authentication (optional).
- **Password** - The password for authentication (optional).

Filtering Webhooks
------------------

Webhooks can be restricted to specific documents using the following filters:

- **Mimetype regex** - Triggers only for documents whose mimetype matches this regex.
- **Title regex** - Triggers only for documents with a title matching this regex (one per line).
- **Content regex** - Triggers only for documents with content matching this regex (one per line).

Example: Discord Notification Webhook
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A real-world application of webhooks is sending a notification to a Discord channel (using the
`Discord REST API <https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro>`_) when a new page is discovered. Below is an example
configuration for integrating with Discord:

Discord Webhook Setup
---------------------

- Create a new webhook in your Discord server by navigating to **Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**.
- Copy the webhook URL provided by Discord.
- Set **URL**: `<Your Discord Webhook URL>`

.. image:: ../../tests/robotframework/screenshots/webhook_add.png
   :class: sosse-screenshot

- Set **Trigger Condition**: ``On discovery``
- Set **Body Template**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "username": "Crawler Bot",
     "avatar_url": "[https://example.com/bot-avatar.png](https://example.com/bot-avatar.png)",
     "content": "A new page has been discovered: **${title}**\nURL: ${url}"
   }

When a new document is discovered, this webhook will send a formatted message to the specified Discord channel,
notifying team members of the new content.
